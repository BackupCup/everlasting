### 1. Everlasting Obelisk

The Everlasting Obelisk is a powerful block that provides a unique buff to players around it. Here's how it works:

- **Durability Empowerment:** The obelisk makes all gear worn by nearby players unbreakable.
- **Fuel Requirement:** It consumes Sculk as fuel for its empowering effect.
- **Lightning Rod Connection:** To transmit the empowering effect, the obelisk requires a connected lightning rod.
- **Overcharge Feature:** You can overcharge the Everlasting Obelisk with lightning strikes. When overcharged, it enhances its empowering effect for a limited time, providing even greater range.

### 2. Treasure Enchantment: Restoring

Equip your gear with the Restoring enchantment to make it truly indestructible. This enchantment works as follows:

- **Durability Protection:** When your gear takes durability damage, the enchantment consumes some of your XP to block that damage.
- **Balanced Gameplay:** Balancing powerful gear with XP consumption adds an exciting twist to your survival experience.

### 3. Everlasting Potion

For a temporary boost of unbreakable gear, use the Everlasting Potion. This potion applies the same effect as the Everlasting Obelisk for a limited time:

- **On-the-Go Protection:** Perfect for adventurers and explorers, the potion grants a short-term immunity to gear durability damage.

### 4. Everlasting Capsule

Discover the Everlasting Capsule in End cities, Ancient Cities, and Bastion treasures. This new item provides a unique twist to durability mechanics:

- **Blocking Damage:** Similar to the Everlasting Obelisk, the Everlasting Capsule blocks damage to your gear.
- **Durability Consumption:** Unlike the Everlasting Obelisk, the capsule loses durability when blocking damage. Manage its durability wisely for prolonged use.
